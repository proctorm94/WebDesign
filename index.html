        <h2>Updates by League</h2>

        <h3>England - Premier League <img src="https://flagdom.com/image/cache/catalog/historical/st-georges-cross-228x228.jpg" alt="England"> </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1st - Liverpool: Looking the real deal, and proving it too!</li>
            <li>2nd - Arsenal: Still complaining about refs, rather than being honest about their deficiencies.</li>
            <li>15th - Tottenham: It could be worse.....but let's hope not!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Spain - La Liga <img src="https://flagpedia.net/data/flags/w580/es.png" alt="Spain"> </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1st - Real Madrid: Tremendous talent compensating for clear weaknesses.</li>
            <li>2nd - Atletico Madrid: Punching above their weight, but also showing unmatched consistency.</li>
            <li>3rd - Barcelona: Objectively playing the best football, but not earning the necessary results</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Italy - Serie A <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANwAAACTCAMAAADSiocKAAAAG1BMVEUAkkbOKzf////j8+vvuLxUtoPecXng8uj00NOLzZE3AAAApElEQVR4nO3PSQEAIBAEoPW2f2JLzE9oQFXK6CGzpcRucnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJycnJyn+VWyknl7k555V6Dg351C9cAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Italy"> </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1st - Napoli: Won their first title in 33 years in 2023, only to mount the worst title defense in recent memory in 2024....could Conte make it 2 in 33?</li>
            <li>2nd - Inter Milan: Fresh off losing a Supercoppa title to their bitter rivals, it seems they're using it as fuel</li>
            <li>3rd - Atalanta: The darkhorse underdogs everyone can root for - faultless intensity and effort</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Germany - Bundesliga <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAMgAAACfCAMAAACLDWbjAAAAElBMVEUAAADgCB37wgYODQ3kJDT8zTGKvegsAAAAmElEQVR4nO3PCQ3AQAAEoevn33JtTDbggHMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAp4R5xohUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUrMTeUece4RIjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IjUiNSI1IzU7kG/EDhRuDQZDIInUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" alt="Germany"></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1st - Bayern Munich: Back on top after losing the title for the first time in 11 years... can Harry Kane finally break his duck and win a trophy?</li>
            <li>2nd - Bayer Leverkusen: Better than most in the league, but are they still burnt out from their Europa League run & undefeated league record from last season?</li>
            <li>3rd - Eintracht Frankfurt: They find a new $50+ million striker every year, but this time they sold him in January - can they maintain their European spot without him?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>France - Ligue 1 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/255px-Flag_of_France.svg.png" alt="France"> </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1st - Paris Saint-Germain: A Qatari funded club with BILLIONS more than the rest of the league combined. How surprising</li>
            <li>2nd - Marseille: 10 points off the leaders, but a once-great club has returned to relevance...for now</li>
            <li>3rd - AS Monaco: One of the best youth academies in the world, but only 4 points above 7th place... can they keep it up in the second half of the season?</li>
        </ul>
